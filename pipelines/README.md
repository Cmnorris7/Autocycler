# Full Autocycler pipelines

This directory contains scripts, wrappers and pipelines contributed by the community for running full Autocycler assemblies. Since everyone's needs differ, there is no one-size-fits-all way to automate Autocycler. These contributions aim to provide examples and inspiration for automating workflows.



## Usage

Feel free to use one of these pipelines as-is, modify it for your needs or write your own pipeline from scratch. If you create a pipeline that you think others might find useful, you are welcome to contribute it to this directory by submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/rrwick/Autocycler/pulls).



## Contributing

If you'd like to add your pipeline to this directory, please follow these basic submission guidelines:

* Place your pipeline in its own directory. Include all required files within this directory.
* Provide some documentation. This can be in the form of a `README.md` file within the pipeline's directory or inline documentation in the file(s).
* Include a license with your pipeline (either as a license file or in the comments at the top of the file) to specify how it can be used, modified or redistributed.
* If you make changes to your pipeline in the future, feel free to submit a PR to update it in the repository.



## Disclaimer

These pipelines are contributed by the community and are not officially maintained or supported. They may become outdated or non-functional with future versions of Autocycler. Use them at your own risk!
